# Reverse an Array

We should write a function named reverseArray that receive an array as argument code and
return a reversed version of the array.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I create a new array of the same length as the received array and
looped throw the received array from the end to the start index.

The complexity is: O(n)
