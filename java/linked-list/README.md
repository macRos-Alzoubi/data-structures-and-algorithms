# Singly Linked List

A data structure which consist of a collection or a sequence of nodes each node contains data and a reference link to
the next node in the sequence.

## Challenge

Implement Linked List by creating Node class and Linked List class,
in side Linked List class implement methods to insert node in the list,
check weather a specific node exist in the linked list
amd toString method to print the linked list collection.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O{
  insert: space => O(1), time => O(1)
  includes: space => O(1), time => O(n)
  toString: space => O(1), time => O(n)
}

## API

<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

insert => Inserts a given value in the beginning of the liked list.

includes => checks if a given value is exist in the linked list.

toString => prints the linked list collection
