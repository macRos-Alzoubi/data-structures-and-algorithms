# Binary Search of Sorted Array

I have been asked to create a function to search an array for a target element using the binary search algorithm.

## Whiteboard Process

![array-binary-search](array-binary-search.svg)

## Approach & Efficiency

I used recursion to perform this task it a powerful and efficient approach

the Big O of this algorithm is:
time: O(log n)
space: O(1)
